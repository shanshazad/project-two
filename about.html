   <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I was born on June, 26 1996 and raised in Chicago, IL. Currently enrolled in Illinois Institute of Technology pursueing a bacherlors degree in (ITM) Information Technology Management. I am first generation here in America, and my parents are from Pakistan, Karachi. </p>

   <h2>Hobbies</h2>

<ul> 
<li>Weightlifting</li>
<li>Cooking</li>
<li>Swimming</li>
<li>Listening to Music</li>
    
</ul>

<p>My interest in weightlifting began when I was only 16 years old. Even though I had tried playing basketball, football, and even baseball none of those were found to be in my interest. I found a true sweet escape from reality everytime I stepped into the gym. I love to cook my own meals because it is important that I am feeding my body with the right nutrition. For cardio, I like to go swimming because it is a full body exercise and it's fun. Music is something I also really enjoy and look forward to.</p>
